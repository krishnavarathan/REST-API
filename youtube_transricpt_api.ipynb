It specifically addresses IP blocking issues often encountered when running on cloud platforms by implementing a proxy configuration using `WebshareProxyConfig`. The process involves installing the necessary library, setting up the proxy with custom headers, fetching transcripts for a given video ID, and then processing the retrieved data into a pandas Series for further analysis with error handling.\n"
